## My Journey

I transitioned to Web Development in 2021, after having worked as an Accounts Manager in a company in Dubai for around 7 years. Have been learning and growing since then in the development field. Have contributed to Open Source as well, and would like to continue more. Currently, working as a Task Lead in the Omdena UAE Local Chapter Challenge for the Project: Abu Dhabi Open Data Intelligence: Empowering Analytics with Falcon LLM Voice Bot.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is more than just a programming language to me. It's a tool that allows me to craft interactive, dynamic, and beautiful user experiences. Its versatility, from front-end frameworks like React to back-end solutions like Node.js, makes it a one-stop language for all things web development.
